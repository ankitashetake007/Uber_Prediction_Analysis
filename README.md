# Uber_Prediction_Analysis

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data using Python and building predictive insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning.
The goal is to understand trip patterns, demand trends, fare variations, and build a model to predict ride-related outcomes.

# Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

- Analyze trip distribution, rush hours, popular locations, and fare patterns

- Build a predictive model (Regression / Classification depending on dataset)

- Visualize patterns and insights using Python libraries

- Demonstrate end-to-end DS workflow: data → EDA → modeling → evaluation

# Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Cleaning

- Handling missing values

- Removing invalid coordinates

- Converting datetime columns

- Creating new features (hour, day, month, distance bins, etc.)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Trip count by hour, day & month

- Distance vs fare relationship

- Peak demand times

- Location-based heatmaps

- Outlier detection

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Examples:

- Ride duration

- Day of week

- Rush-hour flag

- Distance bucket

4️⃣ Model Building

Depending on goal:

- Regression → Predict fare amount

- Classification → Predict whether the fare is above/below average

- Models used may include:

- Linear Regression

- Random Forest

- Decision Tree

- Gradient Boosting

5️⃣ Model Evaluation

- RMSE / MAE (for regression)

- Accuracy / F1-score (for classification)

- Train vs Test comparison

 # Key Insights

- Peak demand occurs during morning & evening rush hours

- Fare amount strongly depends on trip distance

- Short trips are more frequent than long trips

- Weekends show different travel patterns compared to weekdays

- Model performance indicates strong predictive power with engineered features

 # Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow for Uber trip analysis & prediction.
It helps understand user behavior, demand trends, and pricing strategies—valuable for analytics teams and transport businesses.
